# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause
### Name: Raha Priya Dharshini M
### Register no.:212224240124

## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

## Question 8
Write the SQL query that accomplishes the grouping of data by age, calculates the maximum income for each age group, and includes only those age groups where the maximum income is greater than 2,000,000.

Sample table: employee
```

select age, max(income) as "MAX(income)"
from employee
group by age
having max(income)>2000000;
```
## Output

## Question 9
Write the SQL query that accomplishes the grouping of data by age, calculates the average income for each age group, and includes only those age groups where the average income falls between 300,000 and 500,000.

Sample table: employee
```
select age,AVG(income) as "AVG(income)"
from employee
group by age
having AVG(income) between 300000 and 500000;
```
## Output
